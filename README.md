# Hi, I'm Ikechukwu 👋

I'm a cognitive science student working at the intersection of applied ML and full-stack software development. My thesis uses wearable data to model sleep quality and predict recovery patterns. Outside academics, I build voice-focused tools that help creators scale content across languages and platforms, and I ship small projects for fun—web apps, automations, and anything that removes friction. I care about shipping real products, fast, with clean UX and performance that feels invisible.
