# Hi, I'm Isiah

I'm an AI-native builder and Yale cognitive science major super interested in using voice and AI. I'm currently working on my ML+sleep thesis using the ABCD dataset for the MoD Lab in the Yale Department of Psychology, where I'm exploring how machine learning can model and predict sleep patterns. I love building voice-focused tools and AI applications that push the boundaries of human-computer interaction.
